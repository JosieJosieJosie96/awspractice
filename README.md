# My First AWS Cloud Web Application
This repository contains the code for my first cloud web application, built using AWS services. The project demonstrates how to create and deploy a simple web application using AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB. It also uses AWS Amplify for easy deployment and hosting.

## Overview
This project was created to practice and implement the skills I recently acquired through the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. It showcases how to integrate multiple AWS services to build a web application that processes and stores data.

## Technologies Used
AWS API Gateway – Manages and creates API endpoints for communication between frontend and backend.  

AWS Lambda – Handles business logic for the web application.  

Amazon DynamoDB – A NoSQL database to store and retrieve data.  

AWS Amplify – For deploying and hosting the frontend web application.  

JavaScript/HTML/CSS – Used for frontend development, created by Linkedin user Turyn Lim Banda  


## Features
Simple web frontend that interacts with an API.
API Gateway and Lambda work together to process data and store the results in DynamoDB.
Deployed and hosted using AWS Amplify.
